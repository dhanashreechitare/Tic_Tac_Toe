# Tic_Tac_Toe
This project is a simple and interactive Tic Tac Toe game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same device. It demonstrates the use of dynamic UI manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation in JavaScript.

Key Features:

Two-player mode: Players can take turns to place their marks (X and O) on a 3x3 grid.

Win detection: The game automatically detects the winner when a player aligns three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Draw detection: If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a draw.

Reset functionality: Players can restart the game at any time using a reset button.

Responsive and interactive UI: Clean and user-friendly interface with hover effects and visual feedback when a cell is selected.

Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the structure of the game grid and buttons.

CSS: For styling the grid, buttons, and animations.

JavaScript: For implementing the game logic, handling player turns, detecting wins/draws, and updating the UI dynamically.
